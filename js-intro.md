# Intro to Javascript Assessments

Answer these questions, then follow the instructions to submit your first assessment!

#### 1. What is a function? Why would you use one?
A function is a reuseable piece of code that allows you to perform an action, or set of actions, as many times as you direct it to. You activate, or use, a function by calling upon it. This can occur in various ways such as, but not limited to, logging the function to the console, passing the function into another function as an argument, or calling upon the function within another function.

One use of a function would be to perform a task multiple times without having to rewrite that specific action. Instead you would just need to call upon that function. Another use is as a helper to another function. Helper functions are a way to organize your code and allow for easier readability.

#### 2. What is a method?
A method allows you to perform specific actions upon different JavaScript entities such as, but not limited to, strings, numbers, objects, arrays and functions. The action depends on which entity the method is called upon and the type of method used also depends on the entity. Methods generally make writing code more efficient by reducing the number of lines to perform certain tasks.

#### 3. What are some examples of javascript string methods?
Some examples of JavaScript string methods include, but are not limited to, .length, .indexOf() and .substring().

#### 4. Explain the difference between accessor and mutator methods. Why would you use one over the other?
Accessor methods do as the name suggests, accesses specific values within the array it is used on, but does not change the original array. In contrast, mutator methods change the original array in a variety of ways such as adding or removing values.

Determining whether to use an accessor or mutator method depends on whether or not you would like to alter the original array. If you plan on using the original array in more than one function, you may want to stick with accessor methods or iterators that do not alter the original array. Mutators are useful if the goal is to alter the original array.

#### 5. Explain the differences between console.log() and return. Why would you use one over the other?
console.log() logs whatever is inputted between the parentheses to the console. In other words, whatever is in between the parentheses will be displayed on the screen. Return, on the other hand, is used to output a value, but doesn't display the value.

Return is very useful in elements like functions because it allows you to utilize arguments. You can then display the value by calling the function in the console.log(). If you were to use a console.log() when passing in an argument, you may run into an error or an extra undefined value.

Return also allows for you to build more complex functions by using multiple returns within nested elements. If you were to replace these returns with console.log()s, you would display multiple outputs as the computer reads through the function. This is helpful when building a complex function, but not so much when using it for its intended purpose.

#### 6. What is one thing we did in class this week that helped you learn the most?
In my opinion, the exercises, challenges and pair programming are the most helpful tools we do in class. The course is intended to get us ready for the technological work force so I believe a practical approach is the most effective way. Like math, practice solidifies the learning of new concepts and allows you to "stretch" and figure out new or different ways to solve the same problem.
